A better `<input type="file">`.

### What's wrong with `<input type="file">`?

1. It's difficult to skin/style as the look and feel of the element is mostly determined by the user agent.
2. Access to the selected files are provided via `FileList` object, which is a pseudo-array (not a "real" array, with useful sugar like `forEach`, etc).
3. You want any sort of file validation?  Do it yourself!
4. The API is lacking in many respects.

Now, a new, better, evolved (and evolving) element to take its place: `<file-input>`!

__Don't forget to [vulcanize](http://www.polymer-project.org/articles/concatenating-web-components.html)
your main/parent HTML file before deploying into production.  This will ensure
that all of your HTML imports are concatenated into one file.__
